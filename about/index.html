<h2 id="aspect-ratios">Aspect Ratios</h2>
<p>With few exceptions, flags are rectangular, but their sides occur in many
different ratios. Purists will argue that the original intentions of the design
should be upheld. But there is a counterargument.</p>
<p>The proliferation of differing ratios presents interesting trivia, but the
differences are irrelevant when flags are used as visual affordances outside of
official contexts. Their use in emoji pickers provides a compelling example. Here, mismatched proportions degrade the appearance of both
the individual flags and the surrounding layout. The many minor variations would
appear irregular at best, or unintentional at worst.</p>
<p>Designers identify these inconsistencies as a distraction that should be
minimised. The layouts they create rely on repeatable blocks of consistently
sized shapes. With no standard to rely on, the temptation to crop or scale
flags in situ is inevitable. However, such an ad hoc approach greatly
compromises flags with the most extreme widths or heights.</p>

  <figcaption>
    Scaling flags without deviating from their construction rules is an impossible task, as their official constructions often require specific ratios.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Deciding on an aspect ratio is a difficult choice. The most commonly used ratio
is 3:2, of which there are 109 flags in this library. However, 2:1 is also
common, numbering 81 flags. The gap between these two ratios is significant.
When narrower designs are adapted to a wider format, they appear stretched. The
same is true in the other direction — wider flags look uncomfortably squashed in
the narrower format. To compromise, an aspect ratio of 5:3 is used. While less
common than the first two, it offers a happy medium, distorting more flags but
to a much lesser degree.</p>
<p>Modifying the shapes of flags without introducing unnecessary distortions is a
substantial undertaking. With that in mind, changes have been made in a way that
aims to tread as lightly as possible. Each flag has been scaled using strategies
that cater to their specific design elements.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Horizontal, vertical and diagonal bands are stretched to fill the new
dimensions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Emblems and other items in the foreground maintain their proportions when
scaled. For example, if the new flag design is 120% wider, the foreground
elements are increased in both directions by 110%. This balances the change
in distance to the vertical and horizontal edges. However, when stripes
closely contain emblems, they are left unscaled to prevent intersecting elements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Large items like squares and triangles are scaled in a way that best
compromises between the competing relationships that inform them. For
example, if an equilateral triangle points to the center on a narrow flag, it
cannot be widened and keep equal sides. Instead, it is stretched to a lesser
degree, keeping something of the equilateral triangle while still pointing
near the centre of the flag.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="simplification">Simplification</h2>
<p>Many flags use basic geometric constructions, but not all. <a href="/flown/flags/bz">Belize</a>,
<a href="/flown/flags/bo">Bolivia</a>, and <a href="/flown/flags/bn">Brunei</a> feature complex illustrations and
typography in their designs. Much of this detail is unnecessary when flags are
displayed at small sizes. Moreover, the most complex of these designs take up
hundreds of kilobytes, negating the advantages of the vector format.</p>
<p>All flags are drawn on a 1200&times;720 unit grid. The large size of the grid
allows pre-rounding to whole units without visually compromising each design.
Snapping values in this way removes the risk of later minification steps
introducing unwanted distortions. This grid determines the finest level of
detail that is possible, so simplification remains consistent across the
collection. However, an exception is made for typography, which is allowed an
additional decimal place of accuracy to avoid exaggerated distortions. (Consider
use of intelligent transforms/scales to negate this need.)</p>
<p>Shapes are drawn with only a <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> elements, and
colour is exclusively applied with the <code>fill</code> attribute. No <code>stroke</code> or
<code>gradient</code> is applied to any of the artwork. This constraint should make the
collection more amenable to further processing by others, as there are less
corner cases to consider.</p>
<p>Land masses are drawn using only straight lines, so that there shapes can be
simplified using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm">Ramer–Douglas–Peucker</a> algorithm.</p>
<p>Finally, each design has been simplified to fit within a maximum file size of
10kB. The means the most detailed flags feature the highest level of simplification.</p>
<h1 id="colours">Colours</h1>
<p>Despite their tendency towards primary colours, flags exhibit a large degree of subtle, and often unintentional, variation. While some flags dictate the use of specific colours, others are less precise.</p>
<figure>
  <img width="750" height="300" alt="All flag colours" src="/flown/assets/img/palette/all.svg">
  <figcaption>
    The colour palette used by all the original flags includes over a thousand distinct varieties. This profusion tends to fall into broadly similar tones and hues.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Limiting the colour palette means the flags in this collection deviate from
their official designs. However, it ensures that when flags are shown together,
the different combinations are predictable and unlikely to clash. The small,
predefined palette also sets the groundwork for more creative
modifications.</p>
<p>Choosing the best approach to align these colours requires some thinking. An
overly minimal approach would force unnecessary substitutions, significantly
altering the original designs. It&#8217;s also important that the colour palette is
defined by the needs of the flags, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>To construct an initial palette, the full selection of colours was reduced to
smaller sets of various sizes using colour quantisation. This exploration
provided a reduced palette of 16 colours able to reproduce most flags with
reasonable accuracy and minimal duplication.</p>
<figure class="fx fxc gap">
  <img width="320" height="20" alt="Quantized palette" src="/flown/assets/img/palette/16.svg">
  <img width="400" height="20" alt="Quantized palette" src="/flown/assets/img/palette/20.svg">

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But this mechanical selection wasn’t perfect. The quantisation was performed
naively, treating all colours equally regardless of the area they cover. Rarer
colours &#8212; like the turqoise variations used by the <a href="/flown/flags/bs/">Bahamas</a> and <a href="/flown/flags/uz/">Uzbekistan</a>,
or the maroons of <a href="/flown/flags/qa/">Qatar</a> and <a href="/flown/flags/lv/">Latvia</a> &#8212; were lost in the averages. Other
detailed elements were too complex to resolve without additional shades. To
resolve these shortcomings, the palette was carefully expanded to 32 colours.
New colours were added manually to fill gaps according to the flags that were
most affected. Base colours were adjusted to complement these additions.</p>
<p>To prevent introducing too much bias, the palette is mapped to the original flags by computing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000">CIEDE2000</a> colour difference in L*a*b* color space. This ensures consistent mapping of colours and helps to identify issues. When an unexpected color is used, it suggests a weakness in the palette.</p>
<p>Before computing the difference, the b-channel of the Lab colour value is
downweighted and the L-channel is upweighted. The first weighting helps to
emphasise cultural distinctions in primary colours over perceptual differences.
For example, as red moves towards orange, it is more likely to be perceived as a
different primary color compared to an equivalent move towards violet. The
second weighting prioritised tonal similarity over exact hue matching. Note that
this weighting was not chosen scientifically, and may reflect the author’s
biases. There may be an alternative colour model which negates the need to
manipulate the L*a*b weights in this way. However, initial experiments in this
direction were not promising.</p>
<p>Finally, the palette was manually refined to better align the levels of
saturation and brightness of the palette. Again, this reflects the author&#8217;s
personal taste.</p>

    Choosing the final palette has been equal parts art and science.

</figure>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the palette does not include pure white or black. This was originally a result of the colour quantisation, but has its own benefits. The outlines of flags that use large fields of white, such as the Japanese flag, remain defined on pages using a pure white background.</p>
