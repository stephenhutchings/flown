**This library is a work in progress**, involving hundreds of hours of
methodical work redrawing complex design elements. Progress towards an initial
version is slow but steady. Watch this repository to know when the first release
becomes available.

`flown` is a collection of world flags. The library includes SVG files designed
for use in digital applications where quality and visual consistency is
important.

This project is more than a simple collection of images from external sources.
Each flag in the set is meticulously redrawn, using a standardised colour
palette, consistent (but unofficial) aspect ratios and a carefully chosen subset
of SVG tags. Detailed elements, such as emblems and typography, are simplified
to limit file sizes to fit within strict budgets. Where necessary, these
elements are carefully updated to improve quality.

You can read more about the [approach and rationale behind these
modifications](about). Suggestions to
improve the collection are encouraged. If you find an issue with any of the
flags, please create a bug report.
