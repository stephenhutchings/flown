## Aspect Ratios

With few exceptions, flags are rectangular, but their sides occur in many
different ratios. Purists will rightly argue that the original intentions of the
design should be upheld. But there is a counter-argument. Mismatched proportions
degrade the appearance of flags, making outliers appear irregular. Designers
identify these inconsistencies as a distraction that should be minimised. The
layouts they create often rely on repeatable blocks of consistently sized
shapes. There is a temptation to crop or scale the flags as needed, but the
variety of designs is not well suited to this approach.

Deciding on an aspect ratio is another difficult choice. The most commonly used
ratio is 3:2. However, another popular choice is 2:1. The gap between these
options is significant. When the narrower designs are adapted to the wider
format, they appear stretched. The same is true in the other direction --- wider
flags look too squashed in the narrower format. To compromise, an aspect ratio
of 5:3 is used.

Standardising these shapes without introducing distortions is a substantial
undertaking. Scaling flags without deviating from their construction rules is an
impossible task, as their official constructions often require specific ratios.
With that in mind, the modifications have been done in a way that aims to tread
as lightly as possible.

How each flag has been scaled has depended on the nature of the design.
Different elements are handled as follows.

1. Horizontal, vertical and diagonal bands are stretched to fill the new
   dimensions.

2. Emblems and other items in the foreground maintain their proportions when
   scaled. For example, if the new flag design is 120% wider, the foreground
   elements are increased in both directions by 110%. This balances the change
   in distance to the different edges.

3. Large items like squares and triangles are scaled in a way that best
   compromises between the different relationships that inform them. For
   example, if an equilateral triangle points to the center on a narrow flag, it
   cannot be widened and keep equal sides. Instead, it is stretched to a lesser
   degree, keeping something of the equilateral triangle while still pointing
   near the centre of the flag.

<!-- 2. Squares and equilateral triangles have been generally been scaled in a way
   that maintains their proportions. In a similar way, items like crosses are
   scaled so that there vertical and horizontal thicknesses remain in sync. -->
