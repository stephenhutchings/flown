# flown

!!! This is a work in progress

`flown` is a collection of world flags. The library includes SVG files designed for use in digital applications where quality and visual consistency is important.

Each flag in the set is modified to use a standardised colour palette and consistent (but unofficial) aspect ratio. Detailed elements, such as emblems, are simplified to limit file sizes to fit within strict budgets. Where necessary, these elements are redrawn to improve quality. You can read more about the [approach and rationale behind these modifications](/about/).

Suggestions to improve the collection are encouraged. If you find an issue with any of the flags, please create a bug report.
