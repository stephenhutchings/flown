# flown

**This library is a work in progress**, involving hundreds of hours of slow and
methodical work redrawing complex design elements. Progress towards an initial
version is slow but steady. Watch this repository on GitHub to know when the
first release is available.

`flown` is a collection of world flags. The library includes SVG files designed
for use in digital applications where quality and visual consistency is
important.

This project offers more than a simple repackaging of images from external
sources. Each flag in the set is methodically redrawn, using a standardised
colour palette, consistent (but unofficial) aspect ratios and a carefully chosen
subset of SVG tags. Detailed elements, such as emblems and typography, are
simplified to limit file sizes to fit within strict budgets. Where necessary,
these elements are carefully updated to improve quality.

You can read more about the [approach and rationale behind these
modifications](about). Suggestions to
improve the collection are encouraged. If you find an issue with any of the
flags, please create a bug report.
